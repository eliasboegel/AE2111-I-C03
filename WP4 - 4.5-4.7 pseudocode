Hello test 1

Function read_excel: Reads the text file with forces/moment, plate thickness and fastener coordinates and diameter
	split into lines/data
	put coordinates and diameters into a list
	Output coordinate/diameter global list, and forces/moment global dictionary
	

Function calculate_cg: Calculate CG with formula
	Takes list with fastener details
	Uses formula
	Outputs CG coordinates as tuple
	

Function calculate_equivalent_FM: Calculate equivalent force/moment through CG
	Input forces/moment dictionary, and CG tuple
	Use formulas, put equivalent forces and moment into tuple
	

Function in_plane_force: Calculate in plane forces from F_x/F_z
	Input forces and number of fasteners
	Output force
	
	
Function in_plane_moment: Calculate in plane force from moment
	Input moment, details for one fastener, CG coordinates
	Calculate distance from CG for fastener
	Output in plane force due to moment
	
	
Main:
	for i in (list with fastener details)
		total_force = in_plane_force + in_plane_moment
		calculate bearing stress with total_force, fastener diameter
